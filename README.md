- 👋 Hi, I am Mukesh Tiwari
- 👀 I am interested in formal verification (Coq theorem prover), election security, cryptography, and social choice theory.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ZKSNARK because I belive it can change the landscape of electronic voting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on formal verification of cryptographic primitives, vote-counting algorithms.
